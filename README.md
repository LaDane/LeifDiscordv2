## A Discord bot for Royal Danish Forces

Royal Danish Forces is a milsim community that plays ARMA 3 once a week, and occasionally multiple times a week.

This bot was made to solve one of the problems we had involving member sign ups to weekly events.
The bot started out as a project to solve this problem, but quickly grew as more features were added.

Currently the bot has following features:
- Custom event interactions messages with emoji reactions and user input
- Signup system with a json database based on user reactions
- The bot can handle multiple events, with 3 different categories
- Daily updating to check for role changes and missing members in database
- Weekly reminders to users that have not given a reaction to certain events
- Inbuilt video tutorial list editor with reactions and user input
- Give roles based on user commands
- Music integration with Lavalink
